# Overview

{I make this project to learn Kotlin. It was difficult to think of a project to make that didn't include making an android app. I made this currency calculator to learn more about Kotlin.}

{The Currency Calculator takes USD and converts it, roughly, to the currrency you choose.}

{I wrote this code to learn how Kotlin differs from what I know. Java and Python.}
